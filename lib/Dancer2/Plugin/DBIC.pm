=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC;

    get '/users/:user_id' => sub {
        my $user = schema('default')->resultset('User')->find(param 'user_id');

        # If you are accessing the 'default' schema, then all the following
        # are equivalent to the above:
        $user = schema->resultset('User')->find(param 'user_id');
        $user = resultset('User')->find(param 'user_id');
        $user = rset('User')->find(param 'user_id');

        template user_profile => {
            user => $user
        };
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin makes it very easy to create L<Dancer2> applications that interface
with databases.
It automatically exports the keyword C<schema> which returns a
L<DBIx::Class::Schema> object.
It also exports the keywords C<resultset> and C<rset>.
You just need to configure your database connection information.
For performance, schema objects are cached in memory
and are lazy loaded the first time they are accessed.

This plugin is a thin wrapper around L<DBICx::Sugar>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration can be done in your L<Dancer2> config file.
This is a minimal example. It defines one database named C<default>:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=some.db

In this example, there are 2 databases configured named C<default> and C<foo>:

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=some.db
          schema_class: MyApp::Schema
        foo:
          dsn: dbi:mysql:foo
          schema_class: Foo::Schema
          user: bob
          password: secret
          options:
            RaiseError: 1
            PrintError: 1

Each database configured must at least have a dsn option.
The dsn option should be the L<DBI> driver connection string.
All other options are optional.

If you only have one schema configured, or one of them is named
C<default>, you can call C<schema> without an argument to get the only
or C<default> schema, respectively.

If a schema_class option is not provided, then L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader>
will be used to dynamically load the schema by introspecting the database
corresponding to the dsn value.
Remember that you need L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> installed to take
advantage of that.

The schema_class option, should be a proper Perl package name that
Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC will use as a L<DBIx::Class::Schema> class.
Optionally, a database configuration may have user, password, and options
parameters as described in the documentation for C<connect()> in L<DBI>.

You may also declare your connection information in the following format
(which may look more familiar to DBIC users):

    plugins:
      DBIC:
        default:
          connect_info:
            - dbi:mysql:foo
            - bob
            - secret
            -
              RaiseError: 1
              PrintError: 1

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 schema

    my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

The C<schema> keyword returns a L<DBIx::Class::Schema> object ready for you to
use.
If you have configured only one database, then you can simply call C<schema>
with no arguments.
If you have configured multiple databases,
you can still call C<schema> with no arguments if there is a database
named C<default> in the configuration.
With no argument, the C<default> schema is returned.
Otherwise, you B<must> provide C<schema()> with the name of the database:

    my $user = schema('foo')->resultset('User')->find('bob');

=head2 resultset

This is a convenience method that will save you some typing.
Use this B<only> when accessing the C<default> schema.

    my $user = resultset('User')->find('bob');

is equivalent to:

    my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

=head2 rset

    my $user = rset('User')->find('bob');

This is simply an alias for C<resultset>.

=head1 SCHEMA GENERATION

There are two approaches for generating schema classes.
You may generate your own L<DBIx::Class> classes and set
the corresponding C<schema_class> setting in your configuration as shown above.
This is the recommended approach for performance and stability.

It is also possible to have schema classes dynamically generated
if you omit the C<schema_class> configuration setting.
This requires you to have L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> installed.
The C<v7> naming scheme will be used for naming the auto generated classes.
See L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Base/naming> for more information about
naming.

For generating your own schema classes,
you can use the L<dbicdump> command line tool provided by
L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader> to help you.
For example, if your app were named Foo, then you could run the following
from the root of your project directory:

    dbicdump -o dump_directory=./lib Foo::Schema dbi:SQLite:/path/to/foo.db

For that example, your C<schema_class> setting would be C<Foo::Schema>.
